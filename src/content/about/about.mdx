I'm a multidisciplinary software developer with a general interest in all types of development
and love for ambitious tasks.

I graduated from University of California, Irvine in 2018 and worked as a software consultant
for about 2 years. I am currently seeking new opportunities.

When I'm not coding, I'm off playing volleyball 🏐, polishing my barbering skills 💈,
or finding new recipes off of TikTok ‍🍳.
